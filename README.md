# SpringBoot_401
Security: Access Control + Authorization
This file contains exercises 4.01, 4.01 and 4.03.
It was tested using 3 users who were assigned the roles:
Name: user  - user privileges
Name: dave - admin rights
Name: superuser - user and admin rights

3 test templates were used:
1. teacher.html
2. student.html
3. course

These 3 pages used thymeleaf to restrict or allow certain content within each page.
This was used to demonstrate the flexibility of restricting specific content or
functionality within a page in addition to overall access control of the page.
I suppose this could be considered authorization rights.
